## ✨ Features

- ✅ Tells the current time (yes, that’s it).
- ⏱️ Updates **every single second** – like it actually cares.
- 🎨 Various Customisation options including 7 fonts and 8 themes. That's 56 unique clocks!

## 🧠 Fun Fact

This clock is so advanced that it does nothing else. No alarms. No time zones. No atomic sync.
Just pure, clean tick-tock.
